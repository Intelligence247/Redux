// The three fundamentals of redux 
//  1. A STORE that holds the state of your application.
// 2. An ACTION that describes what happened in the application.
// 3. A REDUCER which handles the action and decides how to update the state.
 

// Actions
// The only way your application can interact with the store
// Carry some information from your app to the redux store 
// action is a plain JavaScript objects
// Have a 'type' property that describes something that happened in the application
// The 'type' property is typically defined as string constants 


// Reducers
// Specify how the app's state changes in response to the store
// Fuction that accepts state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the application


// There's usually one Redux Store for the entire application 
// Redux store Responsiblities :
// => It holds application state
// => Allows access to state via getState()
// => Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action)
// => Registers listeners via subscribe(listener)
// => Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener)
